## My favourite recipe dish from Alpay

### WHAT YOU NEED:
 - **Rice**
 - **Water**
 - **Lemon juice**
 - **Salt**
 - **Magarina**

### PREPARATION


**1. Heat your butter in a deep saucepan over a low heat.**

**2. Now add your ÅŸehriye (orzo) to the pan and stir around for a few minutes until you see it start to change colour.**

**3. As soon as you notice the orzo start to go brown, add your cup of rice and continue to stir. Remember to keep the pan over a low heat and keep stirring, otherwise your rice and orzo will burn.**

**4. After 3-4 minutes, add the water or stock.**

**5. There will be a big sizzle and the liquid will bubble up. Turn up the heat and bring the rice to the boil, fully.**

**6. Once the rice is boiling, give it a couple of stirs around, put a lid on the pan, leaving a small gap, and reduce the heat to medium-low.**

**7. Leave your rice to simmer for 8-10 minutes until the water or stock has absorbed.**

**8. Now remove from the heat, put the lid firmly on the pan and leave your Turkish rice to stand for 5 minutes.**

**9. After 5 minutes, remove the lid and fork through your rice.**
